Currently I have implemented a neural network for identifying whether a system generated according to the scripts 3C_Basic_Data_Generator or 3C_Balanced_Data_Generator will experience overshoot, undershoot, or neither in response to a step input. The Jupyter notebook titled "Overshoot & Undershoot Identification" contains the code required to train and test the neural network, and the Jupyter notebook titled "OUID Stress Testing" contains the code which I used to test the neural network on data generated using a larger value of `ulim` than the training data. The script training_functions.py defines functions used in the notebooks.
