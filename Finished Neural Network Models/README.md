These are the neural network models which I have trained so far. Each model is saved together with the scalar used to normalize the input data to zero mean and unit variance.

# OUID_3C_Basic
This is a simple neural network with two hidden layers trained to classify three-coefficient 2nd-order systems into on of three categories: those which experience overshoot, those which experience undershoot, and those which experience neither. It was trained and tested on the dataset called Balanced Dataset 1.

# OUID_3C_Optimized
This neural network serves the same function as OUID_3C_Basic, but it has four hidden layers. It was trained and tested on the dataset called Balanced Dataset 2.
